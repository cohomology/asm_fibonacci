# Fibonacci

This is just a little personal project to write a non trivial assembly program. It infinitely prints all fibonacci numbers 
(arbitrary precision, i.e. can do > 64 bits) without using any additional libraries (e.g. without libc, gmp, etc.). It uses a 
self implemented decimal addition algorithm via the schoolbook method.
